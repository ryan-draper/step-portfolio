      <!-- ABOUT ME -->
      <div id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I'm a sophomore at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and 
            currently interning at Google as a part of their STEP program. 
            From a young age I had a huge interest in consumer tech products
            (shoutout to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=
            "https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee">Marques Brownlee!</a>).
            This interest has since grown into a full-fledged dedication to 
            technology and my goal to help create software solutions to 
            tomorrow's problems. In my free time, I love listening to music, 
            chilling with friends, and cooking breakfast food.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Disease Transmission Mapping (Python)</h3>
        <p> March 2020 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented functions to read in disease transmission data and 
                build a graph where nodes represent hospital patients and edges 
                represent the likelihood of connectedness in transmission based 
                on time difference between hospital visits and gene 
                similarity</li>
            <li>Computed the rooted directed minimum spanning tree (RDMST) of 
                the graph to determine the most likely transmission map, which 
                involves functions such as computing cycles in the graph, 
                contracting cycles into single nodes, and expanding the 
                contracted cycles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Houston Crime Prediction (Python, pandas, scikit-learn)</h3>
        <p> December 2019 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed linear models to predict crime rates by zip code in the 
                Houston area for the year 2020 and beyond </li>
        </ul>
